# Credit Risk Model with Stability Analysis

### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to predict loan default risk for a financial institution. A key objective of this work is to not only achieve high predictive accuracy but also to ensure the model's performance remains stable and reliable over time. This approach addresses a critical real-world challenge in the FinTech industry, where client behavior and market conditions are constantly evolving.

### **Core Concepts**

* **Predictive Modeling:** Using historical data to forecast the probability of a client defaulting on a loan.
* **Time-Aware Analysis:** Implementing a strategic validation framework to test the model's long-term performance and robustness against data drift.
* **Model Stability:** Prioritizing and measuring the consistency of the model's performance over different time periods to ensure it is suitable for real-world deployment without frequent redevelopment.

### **Tech Stack**

* Python
* LightGBM
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

### **Future Work**

This repository is currently under development. Future updates will include:

* Detailed data exploration and feature engineering notebooks.
* Model training and hyperparameter tuning code.
* Comprehensive results and performance metrics.
* A clear explanation of the time-series validation strategy.
